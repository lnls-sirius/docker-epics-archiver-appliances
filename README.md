# Docker images for the EPICS Archiver Appliances

Docker containers holding the EPICS archiver appliances. This repository defines three images: a base image and two others that extend it. Folders `images-single` and `docker-appliance-images` provide images in which all servlets are deployed in either a single or 4 different containers, respectively.

## Building

1) Execute `build-docker-generic-appliance.sh` to build the base image for all the containers which will hold the appliances.
2) Change the working directory to `docker-appliance-images` (or `images-single`) and execute `build-docker-appliance-images.sh` (or `build-images-single.sh`). It will build 4 different images, one for each appliance (or a single one containing all appliances). Before doing that, you may change `setup-appliance.sh` up with your LDAP connection settings. The following command changes the servlet authentication preferences and should be modified with your server settings in case you use it.

```
# Appends new realm
xmlstarlet ed -L -s '/Server/Service/Engine/Host' -t elem -n "Realm" \
                 -i '/Server/Service/Engine/Host/Realm' -t attr -n "connectionURL" -v "ldap://ad1.abtlus.org.br:389" \
                 -i '/Server/Service/Engine/Host/Realm' -t attr -n "alternativeURL" -v "ldap://ad2.abtlus.org.br:389" \
                 -i '/Server/Service/Engine/Host/Realm' -t attr -n "userSearch" -v "(sAMAccountName={0})" \
                 -i '/Server/Service/Engine/Host/Realm' -t attr -n "userSubtree" -v "true" \
                 -i '/Server/Service/Engine/Host/Realm' -t attr -n "userBase" -v "OU=LNLS,DC=abtlus,DC=org,DC=br" \
                 -i '/Server/Service/Engine/Host/Realm' -t attr -n "connectionName" -v "${CONNECTION_NAME}" \
                 -i '/Server/Service/Engine/Host/Realm' -t attr -n "connectionPassword" -v "${CONNECTION_PASSWORD}" \
                 -i '/Server/Service/Engine/Host/Realm' -t attr -n "className" -v "org.apache.catalina.realm.JNDIRealm" \
                 ${CATALINA_HOME}/conf/server.xml

```
Besides the LDAP settings, you may edit the following command with your certificate's right password (`PASSWORD`).

```
# Imports certificate into trusted keystore
keytool -import -alias tomcat -trustcacerts -storepass ${CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD} -noprompt -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -file ${APPLIANCE_FOLDER}/build/cert/archiver-mgmt.crt
```
However, the suggested approach is to pass those parameters as environment variables when the containers are deployed. For further details, refer to this [project](https://github.com/lnls-sirius/docker-epics-archiver-composed).

3) Another image containing all 4 appliances is available in `images-single`. To build it, execute `build-images-single.sh`. The same considerations about the variables are kept for this case.

## Environment variables

This image requires the following parameters when it is executed:

1) `USE_AUTHENTICATION` (`true` or `false`): variable that determines if a LDAP server should be used.
2) `CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` is the self-signed certificate's password.
3) `CONNECTION_URL` and `ALTERNATIVE_URL` are LDAP server addresses. Used when `USE_AUTHENTICATION=true` only.
4) `CONNECTION_USER_FILTER` is the user filter. Used when `USE_AUTHENTICATION=true` only.
5) `CONNECTION_USER_BASE` is the LDAP user base distinguished name. Used when `USE_AUTHENTICATION=true` only.
6) `CONNECTION_NAME` is the binding distinguished name used for LDAP authentication. Used when `USE_AUTHENTICATION=true` only.
7) `CONNECTION_PASSWORD` is the binding password. Used when `USE_AUTHENTICATION=true` only.
8) `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_DATABASE` and `MYSQL_PORT` set the MySQL database connection.
9) `JAVA_OPTS` should be used when eventual JVM parameters need to be used.
10) `APPLIANCE_BASE_MX_PORT` base JMX port used when launching each appliance. For each appliance the port will increase by one.
11) `BASE_TOMCAT_SERVER_PORT` tomcart starting port used on each appliance. Defaults to 1600, increase +1 per appliance.

## Running

Use these images with Docker Compose, Swarm or Kubernetes, according to this [project](https://github.com/lnls-sirius/docker-epics-archiver-composed). For development, we suggest to use the [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool, since no swarm is required. Enjoy!

## Dockerhub
